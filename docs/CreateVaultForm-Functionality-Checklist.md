- [x] **Validation**: Field-level validation with error messages
- [x] **Button States**: Loading states and disabled states working correctly
- [x] **Password Input**: Secure input with visibility toggle functioning

### Transaction Flow
- [x] **Pre-validation**: Wallet connection and parameter validation
- [x] **Transaction Creation**: VaultService.createVault() called with correct params
- [x] **Success Handling**: Transaction success validation with proper status checking
- [x] **Result Extraction**: Vault ID extraction from transaction results
- [x] **Navigation**: Success page navigation with vault ID parameter

### User Experience
- [x] **Loading States**: Multi-stage loading indicators (validating, wallet approval, processing, success)
- [x] **Error Messages**: User-friendly error messages for different scenarios
- [x] **Information Display**: Connected wallet and owner address clearly shown
- [x] **Form Reset**: Form clears after successful submission

### Integration
- [x] **useVault Hook**: Properly integrated with enhanced transaction success checking
- [x] **Cache Invalidation**: Dashboard auto-update after vault creation
- [x] **Component Dependencies**: Button, PasswordInput, LoadingSpinner all working
- [x] **Providers**: PACKAGE_ID and other constants properly imported

### Testing
- [x] **Unit Tests**: Component behavior and validation tested
- [x] **Integration Tests**: Hook integration and parameter flow tested
- [x] **Error Scenarios**: Wallet connection and transaction failure handling tested

### Security
- [x] **Owner Address Security**: Cannot be manually modified, always from wallet
- [x] **Input Validation**: All inputs validated for format and security
- [x] **Exchange Key Security**: Password field with minimum length requirement

## üìã Manual Testing Checklist

### Before Testing
- [ ] Wallet extension installed and configured
- [ ] Connected to correct Sui network (testnet/mainnet)
- [ ] Sufficient SUI balance for gas fees
- [ ] Valid object ID to use as 'locked' parameter

### Test Scenarios
1. **Happy Path**
   - [ ] Connect wallet
   - [ ] Fill all fields with valid data
   - [ ] Submit form
   - [ ] Verify owner address matches wallet
   - [ ] Confirm transaction success
   - [ ] Check navigation to success page

2. **Validation Errors**
   - [ ] Try submitting empty form
   - [ ] Test invalid object ID format
   - [ ] Test short exchange key
   - [ ] Verify error messages display

3. **Wallet Issues**
   - [ ] Test with disconnected wallet
   - [ ] Test transaction rejection
   - [ ] Test insufficient gas scenario

4. **Loading States**
   - [ ] Verify loading indicators during transaction
   - [ ] Check button disabled state during processing
   - [ ] Confirm success state display

## üîß Environment Requirements

### Development
- Next.js 15.5.2
- React 19
- TypeScript
- @mysten/dapp-kit for Sui integration
- @tanstack/react-query for state management

### Blockchain
- Sui testnet/mainnet connection
- Deployed escrow vault smart contract
- Valid PACKAGE_ID in providers.tsx

## üéØ Success Criteria

All items in this checklist should be ‚úÖ for the CreateVaultForm to be considered fully functional with proper owner address handling. The form should:

1. **Automatically use wallet address as owner**
2. **Validate all inputs comprehensively**
3. **Handle all error scenarios gracefully**
4. **Provide clear user feedback throughout**
5. **Successfully create vaults on the blockchain**
6. **Navigate to success page with vault ID**

## üìù Notes

- Owner address implementation is complete and tested
- All validation and error handling enhanced
- Transaction result extraction improved for better vault ID detection
- User experience optimized with proper loading states and feedback
- Security measures in place for sensitive operations
